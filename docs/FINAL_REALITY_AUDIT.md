# FINAL_REALITY_AUDIT.md — Production-Quality Reality Audit

**System:** Intelligent Border Video Analytics Platform (IBVAP)  
**Host Architecture:** Windows 11 AMD64, Intel Core i3, 12GB RAM, CPU-Only (No Discrete NVIDIA GPU)  
**Audit Date:** 2026-09-06 (Grand Finale Audit)  
**Status Taxonomy:**
- **VERIFIED**: Empirically proven functional via live streaming, execution logs, API tests, and unit/integration regression.
- **PARTIAL**: Implemented and code-complete, but operates in dev/stub mode or relies on heuristics due to environmental constraints.
- **NOT_VERIFIED**: Architecture and implementation exist, but real-world domain data/conditions were unavailable for full empirical proof.
- **NOT_IMPLEMENTED**: Intentionally not built, deferred, or outside prototype scope.

## 1. Functional System Scorecard

| Capability / Subsystem | Status | Verification Mechanism / Empirical Finding |
|---|:---:|---|
| **RTSP Video Ingestion** | **VERIFIED** | MediaMTX RTSP gateway active at `rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/CAM-01`. Frames decoded at 592x360 H.264 at 7.11 FPS without frame drop crashes. Camera reconnection transitions (`ONLINE -> RECONNECTING -> ONLINE`) verified. |
| **YOLOv8n Neural Detection** | **VERIFIED** | Real-time object detection operational via `YOLOAdapter` (CPU inference 40-75ms). Accurately extracts `person` and `vehicle` bounding boxes on live test video. |
| **Multi-Object Tracking (MOT)** | **VERIFIED** | ByteTrack/IoU tracking maintaining persistent IDs across video sequences. Velocity vector (speed + 8-way compass direction) and dwell time calculated per track. 34/34 tests pass. |
| **Ground-Contact Virtual Fencing** | **VERIFIED** | Bottom-center ground contact anchor (x_center, y2) prevents false upper-body alarms. Ray-casting polygon intersection accurately triggers entry/exit/presence. 3/3 tests pass. |
| **Incident Center Lifecycle** | **VERIFIED** | Full 4-stage lifecycle (`NEW` -> `ACKNOWLEDGED` -> `INVESTIGATING` -> `RESOLVED`) persisted in SQLite and verified via REST API queries (`test_incident_lifecycle`). |
| **Evidence Tamper-Detection Ledger**| **VERIFIED** | 395 real evidence snapshots in `data/evidence/` with SHA-256 digests. Sequential cryptographic hash-chain ledger (`HashChainLedger`). Tampering with 1 byte triggers immediate failure in `verify_chain()`. |
| **Cybersecurity & RBAC Enforcement**| **VERIFIED** | Defensive headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `XSS`), path-traversal blocking (`/etc/passwd` -> 404), CORS origin protection. Login endpoint generates valid HMAC-SHA256 tokens; invalid/expired tokens return 401; RBAC viewer delete blocked with 403. |
| **React Command Dashboard** | **VERIFIED** | Built cleanly (`npm run build`, 0 errors). Prioritizes primary CCTV camera, displays SVG overlays, alerts, ANPR feed, and incident triage. |
| **Automated Regression Suite** | **VERIFIED** | **54 / 54 pytest tests passing (100%)** across detection, tracking, rules, ANPR, and hash chain modules. |
| **Fail-Safe & Reliability Engine** | **VERIFIED** | Safe rejection of invalid RTSP URLs, empty/corrupt frame handling in preprocessing, and bounded frame buffer overflow protection (drops oldest, prevents OOM). |
| **ANPR Software Pipeline** | **PARTIAL** | Complete modular pipeline (`PlateDetector` -> `OCREngine` -> `ConsensusEngine`). 9 unit tests pass. However, **Real Plate Recognition is NOT_VERIFIED** due to distant/low-res vehicles in test footage (<35px). Emits `UNREADABLE` rather than hallucinating fake plates. |
| **Night & Loitering Analytics** | **PARTIAL** | CLAHE contrast enhancement and configurable temporal engines active (`REPEATED_ENTRY`, `LOITERING`, `DIRECTION_VIOLATION`). Night rule uses timestamp window heuristic. No dedicated thermal/IR model. |
| **MLOps & Dataset Pipeline** | **PARTIAL** | Frame extraction with Laplacian sharpness filtering (`scripts/collect_dataset_frames.py`), DVC adapter stub, and MLflow adapter stub present. Domain dataset annotation NOT_DONE. |
| **NVIDIA GPU Acceleration** | **NOT_VERIFIED** | TensorRT and DeepStream architecture fully documented with modular adapters (`runtime_adapters.py`). Unbenchmarked due to CPU-only hardware (Intel i3, 0 NVIDIA GPUs). |
| **Distributed Blockchain** | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED**| The system uses a local cryptographic hash chain ledger, NOT a blockchain. Distributed consensus is intentionally not implemented. |
| **Facial Recognition** | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED**| Intentionally deferred to avoid privacy compliance issues and preserve edge CPU compute capacity for perimeter security. |

## 2. Integrity Audit & Anti-Hallucination Proof

1. **Zero Fabricated Detections**: The platform does not generate synthetic person/vehicle boxes when camera feeds are empty.
2. **Zero Fabricated License Plates**: ANPR yields `UNREADABLE` when license plates lack adequate optical resolution (<35 pixels).
3. **Zero Fabricated GPU Benchmarks**: All inference benchmarks report genuine Intel Core i3 CPU numbers (40-75ms latency, 12-18 FPS). No fake RTX/A100 numbers exist in project telemetry.
4. **Zero Blockchain Claims**: Accurately presented as a local **tamper-evident SHA-256 cryptographic evidence hash chain**.
