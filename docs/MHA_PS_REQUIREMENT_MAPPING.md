# MHA Problem Statement — Comprehensive Requirement Mapping

## IBVAP vs. MHA/SIH Problem Statement Requirements

**Status Key:**  
- ✅ **VERIFIED (PASS)**: Fully implemented, tested, and empirically validated on live/real data.
- 🟡 **PARTIAL**: Implemented in software and passes unit tests, but operates on heuristic logic or awaiting real-world domain footage.
- 🔵 **PLANNED**: Full modular architecture/adapters designed; hardware or field deployment pending.
- ❌ **NOT_DONE / OUT_OF_SCOPE**: Intentionally omitted or deferred per design decisions.

## Authoritative Requirement Matrix

| # | MHA Requirement | Status | Implementation Details | Test Evidence | Technical Limitations & Next Milestone |
|---|-----------------|:------:|------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| **1** | **Integration with existing IP CCTV / RTSP cameras** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | `services/ingestion/rtsp_source.py`, MediaMTX Gateway | `CAM-01` live H.264 stream decoded @ 7.11 FPS. Camera reconnection transitions verified. | Network reachability required; ONVIF discovery planned for auto-configuration. |
| **2** | **Real-time person detection** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | `services/detection/yolo_adapter.py` + YOLOv8n (CPU) | 54/54 pytest PASS; live person bboxes in telemetry | Running on COCO weights; custom domain fine-tuning pending field dataset. |
| **3** | **Real-time person tracking with persistent IDs** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | `FallbackIoUTracker` + ByteTrack kinematics | 34 tracking tests PASS; persistent IDs, velocity vector, dwell time | High-density occlusions benefit from deep ReID embeddings in future phase. |
| **4** | **Real-time vehicle detection** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | `YOLOAdapter` vehicle class mapping | Real-time vehicle detections on test video (40–75ms CPU latency) | Detection confidence drops when vehicle occupies <2% frame area. |
| **5** | **Vehicle classification (type)** | 🟡 **PARTIAL** | Class mapping (`car`, `truck`, `bus`, `motorcycle`) | Subclass labels visible in live telemetry and event payloads | Specialized border vehicles (military trucks, patrol jeeps) need custom classifier. |
| **6** | **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** | 🟡 **PARTIAL** | Pipeline: `PlateDetector` -> `OCREngine` -> `ConsensusEngine` | 9 unit tests PASS; live video vehicles emit `UNREADABLE` (honest handling) | Real plate validation is **NOT_VERIFIED** due to low resolution (<35px) in test clip. |
| **7** | **Face detection** | ❌ **OUT_OF_SCOPE** | Architecture allows face model in `DetectionEngine` | Intentionally not implemented | Excluded to conserve edge compute and adhere to border surveillance privacy norms. |
| **8** | **Virtual fence / restricted zone enforcement** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | `RuleEngine` + `zones.yaml`; ray-casting geometry | Bottom-center ground contact anchor prevents false torso alarms | Manual coordinate setup in config; polygon drawing tool in UI planned. |
| **9** | **Intrusion detection & real-time alerting** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | `EventCorrelator` -> Incident DB -> WebSocket `/ws/alerts` | Live WebSocket alerts verified; sub-second delivery to React UI | Requires active WebSocket connection; client auto-reconnects. |
| **10** | **Suspicious / unusual activity detection** | 🟡 **PARTIAL** | `TemporalEventEngine` (loitering, repeated entry, direction) | Unit tests pass; kinematic heuristics active in event engine | Deep learning-based trajectory anomaly scoring planned for Phase 2. |
| **11** | **Night-time movement detection** | 🟡 **PARTIAL** | `CLAHEEnhancer` + night temporal window heuristic | CLAHE enhancement verified on low-contrast frames | No dedicated thermal/FLIR infrared model weights in prototype. |
| **12** | **Real-time alert delivery to operator** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | FastAPI WebSocket hub + React dispatch dashboard | Sub-second alert banner, audio chime toggle, triage panel | Persistent message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ) for multi-station clusters. |
| **13** | **Event logging and full audit trail** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | SQLite persistence (`events`, `incidents`, `evidence`, `audit_logs`) | DB records verified; incident REST APIs functional | Remote SIEM (Syslog/ELK) export planned for centralized headquarters. |
| **14** | **Evidence capture with tamper integrity** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | JPEG snapshot + SHA-256 + `HashChainLedger` | 395 real snapshots verified; single-byte corruption caught immediately | Local directory storage; offsite secure replication planned for Phase 2. |
| **15** | **Command and control dashboard** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite | Clean production build (0 errors, 1980 modules); CCTV-first layout | Role-based component gating enabled via backend JWT claims. |
| **16** | **Multi-camera management** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | `configs/cameras.yaml`, `CameraManager`, REST CRUD | Multiple streams handled independently; health states tracked | Multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) cross-camera ReID is future phase. |
| **17** | **Offline / edge operation capability** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | 100% self-contained local stack (MediaMTX, FastAPI, SQLite, React) | Fully operational without external internet connectivity | Validated on Intel Core i3; NVIDIA Jetson deployment planned. |
| **18** | **Scalability** | 🟡 **PARTIAL** | Decoupled worker architecture, bounded frame queues | Single-node execution verified without memory leaks | Clustered multi-node load testing (>8 cameras) requires server hardware. |
| **19** | **Cybersecurity & RBAC** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Real HMAC-SHA256 JWT, RBAC (`VIEWER`, `OPERATOR`, `SUPERVISOR`, `ADMIN`) | `security_reality_test.py` PASS: 401 on forged/expired, 403 on RBAC, traversal blocked | Default production mode is secure; demo bypass requires explicit environment flag. |
| **20** | **NVIDIA GPU acceleration** | 🔵 **PLANNED** | Modular `runtime_adapters.py`, TensorRT/DeepStream docs | Architecture complete; dev system is CPU-only (Intel i3) | Requires procurement of NVIDIA Jetson or workstation GPU. |
| **21** | **Custom trained model** | 🟡 **PARTIAL** | Evaluation harness, training config, frame collection script | Pipeline ready; marked `PENDING_REAL_DATA` | Waiting for annotated border-domain dataset (day/night/thermal). |
| **22** | **Continuous learning / feedback loop** | 🔵 **PLANNED** | Feedback DB schema, active learning sample selector | Skeleton verified via REST; annotation loop pending | Integration with Label Studio or CVAT for active relabeling. |
