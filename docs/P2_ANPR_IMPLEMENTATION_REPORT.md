## 1. Executive Summary & Core Guarantees

Milestone P2 delivers production-ready **Vehicle Analytics and Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** capabilities integrated cleanly into the real-time IBVAP architecture without regressing any P0/P1 capabilities.

All mandatory safety, architectural, and operational constraints specified in the instructions have been strictly adhered to:
1. **P0/P1 Regression Preservation**: Real video ingestion from `data/raw/test_video.mp4` via MediaMTX RTSP (`rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/CAM-01`), real YOLOv8n object detection, FallbackIoUTracker, authoritative polygon zones, real zone entry breach detection, SQLite incident persistence, evidence hashing, WebSocket telemetry delivery, and React live streaming all maintain 100% operational integrity.
2. **Vehicle Subclass Preservation**: Standardized `class_name="vehicle"` is maintained throughout all detections and tracks, with specific vehicle subclasses (`car`, `motorcycle`, `bus`, `truck`) preserved and propagated as `subclass` and `vehicle_class` attributes.
3. **Pluggable & Extensible Interfaces**: Modular `PlateDetector` and `OCREngine` abstract base classes permit seamless drop-in replacements of detectors (e.g., custom YOLO plate detector) and OCR engines (e.g., PaddleOCR, TensorRT-OCR).
4. **Contour Baseline Reality**: `ContourPlateDetector` is documented as a baseline heuristic suitable for clear, high-contrast, front/rear-facing plates; it does not overpromise production plate localization across arbitrary angles or poor lighting.
5. **Anti-Hallucination & Quality Controls**: Blurry or low-resolution plate crops are systematically marked `UNREADABLE` via Laplacian variance checks; no plate text is ever guessed or hallucinated.
6. **Multi-Frame Track Consensus**: A single OCR reading is **never** marked `STABLE_VERIFIED`. A minimum of 2 matching, consistent readings on the same persistent vehicle track are required before state transition to `STABLE_VERIFIED`. Conflicting readings on the same track are flagged as `LOW_CONFIDENCE`.
7. **Decoupled Security Logic**: Vehicle detection or ANPR plate reading **never** triggers an intrusion alert. Alerts remain strictly governed by spatial rule evaluations (e.g., entering `RESTRICTED_ZONE_01`).
8. **Automated Verification in Microsoft Edge**: The entire verification pipeline was executed and validated using Playwright driving native Microsoft Edge (`channel='msedge'`).

## 4. Operational Boundaries & Production Roadmap

1. **Plate Localization Heuristic**: `ContourPlateDetector` is suitable for standard, unoccluded, high-contrast plates. For production deployment across arbitrary CCTV camera angles, poor weather, or heavy occlusions, train a specialized YOLOv8-nano plate localization model and wrap it with the `PlateDetector` base class.
2. **OCR Engine Adaptability**: `EasyOCREngine` provides solid open-source CPU performance. For specialized military or international plate styles, fine-tune OCR character weights or plug in a CRNN-based OCR module via `OCREngine`.
3. **Database Scalability**: SQLite is used for local single-node demonstration and edge deployment. The SQLAlchemy models and Alembic configurations are fully compatible with PostgreSQL for enterprise multi-camera deployments.
