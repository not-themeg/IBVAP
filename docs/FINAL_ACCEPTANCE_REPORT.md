**Demonstration Milestone**: Monday SIH Final Production Prototype  
**Date & Time**: 2026-09-05 20:30 UTC

## 1. System Engineering Status Summary

All core security systems, video ingestion layers, neural inference pipelines, cryptographic audit ledgers, and operational user interfaces have been verified, stabilized, and hardened according to the strict engineering directive:
`STABILITY > CORE PS > AI QUALITY > SECURITY > EVIDENCE > ADVANCED FEATURES > COSMETICS`.

| Subsystem | Status | Verification Mechanism / Metric |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Ingestion Layer** | **`PASS`** | Dual source support: Live Android Phone Camera (`http://10.63.26.249:8080/video`) + MediaMTX RTSP (`rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/CAM-01`). |
| **Object Detection & Abstraction** | **`PASS`** | YOLOv8n CPU adapter + pluggable runtime adapters (`ONNXRuntimeAdapter`, `OpenVINOAdapter`, `TensorRTAdapter`). Zero proprietary lock-in. |
| **Multi-Object Tracking** | **`PASS`** | ByteTrack / Fallback IoU tracker maintaining persistent track IDs, velocity vectors, and trajectory history. |
| **Spatial Rule Engine** | **`PASS`** | Bottom-center ground contact point (`x=center_x, y=y2`) polygon virtual fencing preventing false upper-body bounding box alarms. |
| **Cryptographic Evidence Ledger** | **`PASS`** | Sequential local SHA-256 hash chain (`evidence_hash_chain`) with genesis linking and automated tamper-detection audit. |
| **Incident Lifecycle Management** | **`PASS`** | Full 4-state lifecycle transitions: `NEW` -> `ACKNOWLEDGED` -> `INVESTIGATING` -> `RESOLVED` with operator audit logging. |
| **Vehicle Analytics & ANPR Pipeline** | **`PASS`** | Subclass preservation (`car`, `truck`, `bus`, `motorcycle`). Anti-hallucination multi-frame consensus engine. |
| **Frontend Operations Dashboard** | **`PASS`** | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite build passing cleanly (0 errors). Synchronized SVG bounding box/zone overlays. |
| **Test Suite Coverage** | **`PASS`** | 54 / 54 Unit & Integration Tests **PASSED** in 5.6s across all test modules (`tests/`). |

## 3. Honest Real-World Constraints Disclosure

Per engineering integrity mandates:
1. **Real-World License Plate Resolution**: Standard phone camera distance feeds and test footage at 592x360 render license plates as sub-pixel background features (<35 pixels wide). In accordance with strict anti-hallucination rules, these are marked `UNREADABLE` / `NOT_VERIFIED` rather than hallucinating artificial plate strings.
2. **CPU Execution Envelope**: On Intel Core i3 hardware without discrete NVIDIA GPU, YOLOv8n operates at 12-18 FPS with inference latency between 40ms and 75ms. The UI display and streaming server are completely decoupled from inference to maintain smooth video rendering.

## 4. Master Command Reference

To launch the complete demonstration, verify services, or run audits:
```powershell
# Master interactive demo with automated startup and Edge browser verification:
.\scripts\ibvap.ps1 demo

# Inspect running PIDs and service health:
.\scripts\ibvap.ps1 status

# Run the 54-test regression suite:
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Clean environment and reset demonstration state:
.\scripts\ibvap.ps1 clean
```
