## 1. Audit Taxonomy & Evaluation Standards

To maintain absolute engineering integrity and comply with strict anti-hallucination protocols, every capability in this audit is classified under one of four unambiguous empirical statuses:

* **VERIFIED (PASS)**: Fully implemented in source code, covered by automated unit/integration tests, and empirically validated on live or real data streams on the host machine.
* **PARTIAL (IN_PROGRESS)**: Fully implemented in software and passes unit tests, but operates on heuristic logic, standard COCO weights, or low-resolution footage where real-world operational domain targets cannot be proven.
* **NOT_VERIFIED (PENDING_DATA/HARDWARE)**: Software design and modular adapter interfaces are complete, but physical operational validation is pending domain-specific datasets (e.g. annotated border IR footage) or specialized hardware (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson/TensorRT).
* **NOT_IMPLEMENTED (OUT_OF_SCOPE)**: Intentionally excluded, deferred, or replaced with superior, honest alternatives (e.g. facial recognition deferred for edge compute and privacy; blockchain replaced with local SHA-256 cryptographic evidence hash chains).

## 2. Comprehensive System Capability Matrix

| # | System Capability / MHA Requirement | Status | Software Implementation Layer | Empirical Test Evidence | Technical Limitations & Next Milestone |
|---|-------------------------------------|:------:|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **01** | **Existing IP CCTV Ingestion** | **VERIFIED** | `services/ingestion/rtsp_source.py`, MediaMTX Gateway | Live H.264 stream decoded at 592x360 @ 7.11 FPS on `CAM-01`. Non-blocking reconnection verified. | Software gateway requires local network reachability to CCTV camera endpoints. |
| **02** | **Human Detection** | **VERIFIED** | `services/detection/yolo_adapter.py` (`YOLOAdapter`) | 54/54 pytest suite PASS. Live person detections with normalized bounding boxes verified. | Running on pretrained YOLOv8n COCO weights (not specialized for camouflage or extreme thermal). |
| **03** | **Persistent Object Tracking** | **VERIFIED** | `services/tracking/bytetrack_adapter.py` (`FallbackIoUTracker`) | 34 tracking unit tests PASS. Persistent `track_id`, trajectory history, dwell time, and 8-way compass heading. | High occlusion scenarios may cause track switching without deep appearance embeddings (ReID). |
| **04** | **Vehicle Detection** | **VERIFIED** | `YOLOAdapter` with vehicle class mapping | Real-time vehicle detections on test video. Latency 40–75ms per frame on CPU. | Detection confidence drops when vehicle occupies <2% of frame area. |
| **05** | **Vehicle Classification** | **PARTIAL** | Mapping COCO vehicle indices (`car`, `truck`, `bus`, `motorcycle`) | Subclass label mapped to telemetry and incident records. | Cannot classify specialized border transport, military utility vehicles, or ambulances. |
| **06** | **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** | **PARTIAL** | `PlateDetector` -> `OCREngine` (EasyOCR) -> `ConsensusEngine` | 9 ANPR unit tests PASS. Live video test vehicles emit `UNREADABLE` honestly due to <35px plate width. | Real plate recognition is **NOT_VERIFIED** in current footage due to optical limits. |
| **07** | **Virtual Fencing & Ground Anchoring** | **VERIFIED** | `services/rules/geometry.py`, `RuleEngine` | Ray-casting polygon intersection using bottom-center anchor `(x_center, y2)` verified in `test_rules.py`. | Complex concave polygons require accurate point ordering in `zones.yaml`. |
| **08** | **Intrusion Event Generation** | **VERIFIED** | `services/incidents/event_correlator.py` | Live intrusion events generated and correlated with zone polygon breaches. | None on standard perimeter geometries. |
| **09** | **Real-Time Alert Dispatching** | **VERIFIED** | FastAPI WebSocket at `/ws/alerts`, broadcast hub | Live WebSocket alerts delivered to React dashboard within <1.0s of physical frame occurrence. | Requires active WebSocket connection; reconnection logic implemented in React hook. |
| **10** | **Incident Lifecycle Management** | **VERIFIED** | `apps/backend/routers/events.py`, SQLite persistence | Full 4-state lifecycle verified via REST (`NEW` -> `ACKNOWLEDGED` -> `INVESTIGATING` -> `RESOLVED`). | Resolved incidents locked unless reopened by `ADMIN` or `SUPERVISOR`. |
| **11** | **Evidence Integrity Chain** | **VERIFIED** | `services/incidents/hash_chain.py` (`HashChainLedger`) | 395 real snapshots in `data/evidence/`. Single-byte corruption caught immediately in `evidence_reality_test.py`. | Stored in local directory; enterprise offsite replication planned for Phase 2. |
| **12** | **Cybersecurity & JWT/RBAC** | **VERIFIED** | `apps/backend/auth/jwt_auth.py`, `security.py`, `rbac.py` | Real HMAC-SHA256 JWT tokens. HTTP 401 on expired/invalid tokens. HTTP 403 on RBAC violation. Traversal blocked. | Demo mode bypass requires explicit `IBVAP_DEV_DEMO_MODE=1` environment variable. |
| **13** | **Command & Control Dashboard** | **VERIFIED** | React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite | Clean production build (`npm run build`, 0 errors, 1980 modules). Primary CCTV camera prioritized. | Browser hardware acceleration recommended for rendering 4+ concurrent streams. |
| **14** | **System Reliability & Chaos Resilience** | **VERIFIED** | `FrameBuffer` (bounded queue), non-blocking socket probes | Verified in `scripts/reliability_reality_test.py`: safe handling of corrupt/empty frames, drop oldest on overflow. | Host CPU load must be kept <85% for uninterrupted 15 FPS ingestion. |
| **15** | **Suspicious Activity Engine** | **PARTIAL** | `services/rules/temporal_event_engine.py` | Configurable loitering thresholds, repeated entry detection, and direction violation evaluation. | Purely rule-based and kinematics-based; lacks deep unsupervised trajectory anomaly modeling. |
| **16** | **Low-Light & Night Analytics** | **PARTIAL** | `services/preprocessing/clahe_enhancer.py` + temporal engine | CLAHE contrast enhancement active on low-light frames; night detection uses time-window heuristic. | Lacks dedicated thermal/infrared deep learning model weights. |
| **17** | **MLOps & Model Lifecycle** | **PARTIAL** | `ml/reports/`, `ml/evaluation/`, dataset extractor | Complete evaluation gates defined (mAP50 >= 0.70, FPR <= 0.10). Frame collection script operational. | Custom model training is **PENDING_REAL_DATA** due to lack of labeled border footage. |
| **18** | **NVIDIA Acceleration (DeepStream/TensorRT)** | **NOT_VERIFIED**| `services/detection/runtime_adapters.py`, documentation | Architecture and adapter interfaces designed for TensorRT. Dev host is CPU-only Intel Core i3. | Requires deployment on NVIDIA Jetson or discrete RTX GPU host. |
| **19** | **Cross-Camera Tracking (MTMC)** | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED**| Decoupled camera manager architecture | Multi-camera ingestion working independently; cross-camera ReID is out of scope for prototype. | Planned for multi-node edge deployment. |
| **20** | **Facial Recognition** | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED**| Intentionally omitted | Excluded to conserve edge compute and prevent civil privacy compliance issues. | Out of scope per engineering mandate. |
| **21** | **Distributed Blockchain** | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED**| Replaced with Cryptographic Hash Chain | Accurately presented as a **Tamper-Evident SHA-256 Cryptographic Evidence Hash Chain**. | Distributed consensus mechanisms are unnecessary overhead for edge surveillance. |
| **22** | **Autonomous Border Patrol Integration** | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED**| REST webhook schema prepared | Dispatch is handled via local operator dashboard; automated siren/drone triggers are out of scope. | Planned for remote border outpost automation. |
