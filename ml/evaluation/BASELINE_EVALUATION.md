## 1. Measured Performance Metrics

The baseline model utilizes standard COCO general pretraining without domain-specific border surveillance fine-tuning:

| Metric | Measured Value | Standard Threshold | Evaluation Result |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Precision (P)** | 0.640 | $\ge 0.60$ | **PASS** |
| **Recall (R)** | 0.528 | $\ge 0.50$ | **PASS** |
| **mAP@0.50** | 0.568 | $\ge 0.50$ | **PASS** |
| **mAP@0.50:0.95** | 0.373 | $\ge 0.30$ | **PASS** |
| **CPU Inference Latency** | 40–75 ms | $\le 100	ext{ ms}$ | **PASS** |
| **Throughput (CPU)** | 13.3–25.0 FPS | $\ge 10	ext{ FPS}$ | **PASS** |

## 2. Strengths & Limitations in Border Surveillance

### Strengths
- Highly optimized for real-time CPU execution on low-cost edge server hardware.
- Strong generalization on upright pedestrians in standard daylight conditions.
- Reliable separation of vehicle subclasses (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles).

### Known Limitations
- Lower recall on individuals in low-contrast camouflage uniforms blending with arid or jungle terrain.
- Reduced confidence when individuals are crawling or crouching along perimeter fences.
- Optical degradation during nighttime/pitch-black conditions without supplemental lighting.
